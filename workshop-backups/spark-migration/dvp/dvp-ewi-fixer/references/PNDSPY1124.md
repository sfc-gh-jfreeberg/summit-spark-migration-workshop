# PNDSPY1124

Element has a partial mapping but there are a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

Message: Pandas < ***pandas.core.groupby.groupby.GroupBy.all*** > has a partial mapping with a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

Category: Warning.

## Description

This issue appears when the SMA detects the use of a Pandas element that has a direct equivalent in Snowpark Pandas, but some scenarios might behave differently than Pandas.


**Reason (from Snowpark documentation):** N for non-integer/boolean types

## Scenario

**Input**

Below is an example of a method with a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar'], 'B': [1, 2, 3, 4]})
grouped = df.groupby('A')
result = grouped.all
```

**Output**

The SMA adds the EWI `PNDSPY1124` on the output code to let you know that this element has a few scenarios not supported in Snowpark.

```python
import snowflake.snowpark.modin.pandas as pd

#EWI: PNDSPY1124 => pandas.core.groupby.groupby.GroupBy.all has a partial mapping, with few scenarios not supported. Check Snowpark Pandas documentation for more detail.
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': ['foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'bar'], 'B': [1, 2, 3, 4]})
grouped = df.groupby('A')
result = grouped.all
```

**Recommended fix**

**Data type consideration**: N for non-integer/boolean types

Ensure data types are compatible:
- Check column dtypes with `df.dtypes` before the operation
- Use `.astype()` to convert columns to expected types
- Numeric operations may require explicit casting: `df['col'].astype(float)`

## Additional recommendations

- Check the [Snowpark Pandas documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark/reference/python/latest/modin/supported/index) to verify which scenarios are not supported for that specific element.
